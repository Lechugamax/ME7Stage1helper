# ME7Stage1helper
Simple ME7 Stage1 remap calculator

This spreadsheet aims to facilitate simple Stage1 remaps for the Bosch ME7 ECU. It is inspired on the ME7 TUNER WIZARD from MASTERJ (available here: https://github.com/masterjguscius/NefMotoOpenSourceCollaboration).

The spreadsheet is password protected to prevent accidental mistakes. It is "powerpass" (use at your own discretion).
